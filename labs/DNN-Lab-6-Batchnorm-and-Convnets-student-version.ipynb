After doing each of the tasks you can look at the plots and check how your changes impact gradients of network layers.\n","* In task 7 you will implement a convnet using [conv2d](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html) and try to reach 99% accuracy on MNIST.\n","\n","For this notebook, running on CPU is sufficient: tasks 1–5. run under a minute, 6. under two minutes, and 7. up to 5 minutes.\n","\n","Tasks:\n","1. Check that the given implementation reaches 95% test accuracy for\n","   the architecture `input-64-64-10` in 8 epochs.\n","2. Modify `Linear.reset_parameters()` to improve initialization and\n","   check that the network learns much faster and reaches over 97% test accuracy.\n","   A good basic initialization scheme is so-called *Glorot initialization*.\n","   For a linear layer with $n_{in}$ and  $n_{out}$ input and output features,\n","   it samples each weight from a normal distribution with $0$ mean and a standard deviation of $\\sqrt{\\frac{2}{n_{in}+n_{out}}}$.  \n","   Check how that changes the distribution of gradients at the first epoch.\n","3.

Implement Dropout as a PyTorch module (without using torch.nn.Dropout).\n","   Use `p=0.25` as the zeroing probability.\n","   Use Dropout after activations of each layer, except the last.\n","5. Check that with 10 hidden layers (64 units each), even with proper initialization,\n","   but with dropout added, the network has a hard time to start learning.\n","6. Implement batch normalization (without using torch.nn.BatchNorm).\n","    * compute batch mean and variance\n","    * add new variables beta and gamma\n","    * check that the network learns even for 10 hidden layers.\n","    * check how gradients change in comparison to network without batch norm.\n","   \n","   In pseudo-code:\n","    ```\n","\t\tif training:\n","\t\t    var, mean = torch.var_mean(x, dim=/batch/)\n","\t\t    update running_mean, running_var\n","\t\telse:\n","\t\t\tmean, var = running_mean, running_var\n","\t\tx = (x - mean) / sqrt(var + eps)\n","\t\treturn x * gamma + beta\n","    ```\n","\n","7.
