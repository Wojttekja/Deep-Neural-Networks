implementation of a simple neural network, and your goal is to implement the backpropagation procedure for this network.  \n","\n","To be more precise, the network inputs a tensor $x$ of shape `(MINI_BATCH_SIZE, 28*28)`, where each element of the batch represents a flattened grayscale image of shape `(28, 28)`.  \n","In exercise 1, you can assume that images in the minibatch are fed to the network one by one (as tensors of shape `(1, 28*28)` - single image and `(1, 10)` - image class).  \n","In exercise 2 you are asked to make the backpropagation work without this assumption, on whole mini-batches.  \n","In exercise 3, you will implement a technique called *gradient checkpointing*, that allows you to reduce the amount of memory used to store activations for backpropagation."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"6y4l5BmxTNNU"},"outputs":[],"source":["from pathlib import Path\n","from typing import Sequence, Iterator,
